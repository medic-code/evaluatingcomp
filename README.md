# EvalComp 

 EvalComp takes content from the web and using Open AI's GPT model this information to create a reasoned analysis of a company using a framework that you can choose. It uses the lean canvas as a basis, but can go beyond this. 


# Features

The user will need to gather content of high quality related to a company. The default framework will be chosen, but users will have the ability to choose their questions. 

The large language model will use these resources and summarisations to provide answers to the framework questions. 

The output will be a company profile that fits your specific screen
